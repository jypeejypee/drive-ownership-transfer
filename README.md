## 🔐 Files Required (Not Included)

---

## 🧪 Setup Instructions

1.Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/drive-ownership-transfer.git
cd drive-ownership-transfer

2.Install dependencies
npm install

3.Add your Google OAuth credentials
Place your credentials.json in the root directory. It should look like:
{
  "installed": {
    "client_id": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
    "project_id": "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
    "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
    "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
    "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
    "client_secret": "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",
    "redirect_uris": ["http://localhost"]
  }
}

4.Run the app
node index.js

5.Authorize access
You’ll be given a URL in the terminal.

Visit it, log in to your Google account, and paste the returned code back into the terminal.

6.Check results
After successful authorization, the app will:

Grant editor access to the recipient

Send an ownership request

📬 What Happens Next?
The recipient should go to Google Drive → Shared with me → File → Share.

A “⚠️ Owner request pending” message will appear.

They must accept the ownership manually the first time.

After the first manual acceptance, future transfers can happen automatically.

📄 Notes
This only works with @gmail.com addresses (not Google Workspace).

Only files (not folders) can be transferred with the API.

The app uses https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive scope for full access.
